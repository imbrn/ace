## What is it?

Ace is designed to be a really small and lighweight engine for 2D games.

- It has no complicated physics;
- It has no fancy tools for making advanced games;
- It's just a wrapper around the HTML Canvas abstraction with a basic game loop; and some more nice stuff :)

That's it. It's perfect for the ones that are making simple games for fun or learning. If your intention is to making advanced and powerful games, there are a lot of better options outside there.

## Development stage

> Ace is in a very initial development stage. It's not ready for production yet.

**It'll be awesome if you become part of this**. Contributions are really really welcome! Let's have fun! :)

## Installing

### Install it using npm (or yarn)

```sh
npm install @imbrn/ace
```

_or_

```sh
yarn add @imbrn/ace
```

### Install it using a CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@imbrn/ace/dist/ace.min.js"></script>
```

_or_

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@imbrn/ace/dist/ace.min.js"></script>
```

> For other installation options, or if you want to start developing your own version, check the [building section](#building).

## Basic example

```js
import { Game, Scene, rect } from "ace.js";

// Implementing a game scene
class MyGameScene extends Scene {
  constructor() {
    super({ width: 1600, height: 900 });
  }
  
  udpate(elapsedTime) {
    // update your game progress
  }
  
  draw(canvas: Canvas) {
    // draw your game state this.canvas API
    canvas.fillStyle = "black";
    canvas.fill(rect({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1600, height: 900 }));
  }
  
  onClick(event) {
    // capture user click events
  }
  
  onKeydown(event) {
    // capture user keydown events
  }
}

// Creating game
const game = new Game(document.querySelector("#my-canvas"));
game.currentScene = new MyGameScene();
game.start();
```

## Building

After cloning this repo, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

For building the library, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

_This is going to create a `build` folder with the generated Javascript files for CommonJS, UMD, AMD, ESM, browser and system modules._

For running the examples, you can execute:

```
npm start
```

_This is going to start a local server with hot-reload enabled by default. Then, you can open your browser, access the address indicated in the console and add /example-name for accessing the example-name._
